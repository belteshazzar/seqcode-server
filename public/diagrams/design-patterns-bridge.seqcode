# Design Pattern - Bridge
# -----------------------

note(360, 120, 300, The Bridge design pattern is a way to separate two pieces of code that can change independently, making your program more flexible and easier to maintain. Itâ€™s like having a "bridge" that connects two separate parts of your code so they can work together without being tightly linked. )
