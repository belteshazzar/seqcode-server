# Design Pattern - Chain of Responsibility
# ----------------------------------------

note( 364, 295, 300, The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is like a series of "handlers" that process a request one at a time until one of them can handle it. Itâ€™s useful when you want to pass a request through a sequence of objects without knowing which one will deal with it. )

c : Client
h : Handler
h2 : Handler
h3 : Handler
h4 : Hander

h.handle(request) {
  h2.handle(request) {
    h3.handle(request) {
      h4.handle(request) {
      }
    }
  }
}
