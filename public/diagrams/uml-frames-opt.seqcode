# Optional (opt) Frames
# ---------------------

ref( Frames | /diagrams/uml-frames )

note( 100, 90, 400, An opt frame represents an optional interaction that happens only if a specific condition is true. Itâ€™s like an "if" statement in programming. The condition is written at the top of the frame in square brackets [], and the interactions inside the frame occur only if the condition is met. )

# For example, in an e-commerce system, an opt frame might show
# sending a "discount coupon" email, which happens only if the 
# user has made a purchase above a certain amount.

me : actor
shop.buy(something) {
  later() {
    opt( Purchase > $100 ) {
      me.sendDiscount()
    }
  }
}
