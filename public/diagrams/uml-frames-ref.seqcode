# Reference (ref) Frames
# ----------------------

ref( Frames | /diagrams/uml-frames )

note( 100, 90, 400, A ref frame (short for "reference frame"\) is used to connect or refer to another sequence diagram or a part of a diagram. It helps keep diagrams simple by breaking a big, complex interaction into smaller, easier-to-understand pieces. The ref frame shows that at this point, the system follows the steps described in the other referenced diagram.)

# For example, in a shopping app, a ref frame might point to a 
# separate diagram that shows the detailed process of "payment 
# processing," so you donâ€™t have to repeat all those steps in 
# the main diagram.

app.buy() {
  ref(Process Payment | /diagrams/uml-frames-ref-process )
