note( 100, 90, 400, A neg frame represents a part of the interaction that is not allowed or invalid in the system. Itâ€™s used to highlight interactions or sequences that should never happen. If the system encounters this situation, it would indicate an error or an exceptional condition. )

# For example, in a payment system, a neg frame might show a scenario
# where a "refund" is processed before the "payment" was completed,
# which is not allowed.
