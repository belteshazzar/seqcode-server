# Design Pattern - Flyweight
# --------------------------

note(300, 3, 300, The Flyweight design pattern helps save memory when you have many similar objects by sharing the common parts instead of creating full copies of each one. Itâ€™s like reusing things instead of making new ones every time. )

c : Client

f : Factory

a : FlyWeight

f.get(keyA) {

  return(a)
}

f.get(keyA) {

}

f.get(keyB) {
  b.create()
