# Critical Frames
# ---------------

ref( Frames | /diagrams/uml-frames )


note( 100, 90, 450, A critical frame represents a block of interactions that must be completed without any interruptions. Itâ€™s used to show that the actions inside the frame need to happen as a single, uninterrupted sequence to ensure correctness, like a "do not disturb" zone for interactions. This is especially important when multiple processes might compete for resources or when timing is critical. )

# For example, in a banking system, transferring money from one
# account to another could be shown inside a critical frame to 
# make sure the withdrawal and deposit happen together without 
# any interference.

bank : Bank
acc1 : Account
acc2 : Account

    acc1.withdraw(10)
